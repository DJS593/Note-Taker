  ## Description 
  The app allows the user to enter notes beginning with a title and then a brief description.  The user can save the note using the save icon.  Once saved, the note will reside on the left side of the page.  In addition, to making new notes, the user can delete unwanted notes using the trash icon.  On the back-end the notes are added / deleted from a JSON file.  Each entry (note) is given a unique ID.  If a note is deleted, the IDs are "re-ordered."
